# Code Refactor Starter Code
Refactoring a code means to make edits to the source code without changing the function of the code. 

This challenge was to change the given starter code to follow the right syntax and using the right semantic elements to group differect sections of the website together using what was learned in Week 1 of the bootcamp. 

This task was to make a website more user friendly by changing the web accesibility to accomodate users with disabilities. 

Making a code more clear and concise by using the right semantic elements and cleaning up repetitive css selectors makes the code useful for long term. This also helps when working in a team as the code is 'cleaner' to look at.
